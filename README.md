# SAX â€“ SHARP APL for UNIX

I have chosen to make available this latest version of [SAX](https://apl.wiki/SAX) free of charge FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY, even though it is proprietary commercial software of [Soliton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton_Incorporated). I am doing this because:
* Soliton [was dissolved in 2015](https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpDtls.html?corpId=3214532).
* J. Clarke [testified](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.lang.apl/c/RmYZT3uXEso/m/1CoDs690BwAJ) that he was "not aware of their intellectual property being transferred to any other business or person."
* Three people have independently assured me that Soliton had let them receive the unlimited SAX product free of charge. This fits with what Soliton [offered](https://web.archive.org/web/20150228103547/http://www.soliton.com:80/solutions-linux.html) on their website:
  > Soliton is pleased to offer the APL enthusiast SHARP APL for Linux to promote the use APL as a tool of thought for students, mathematicians, engineers, analysts, actuaries, application developers, and as a rapid application development environment. SHARP APL for Linux has the same functionality as the versions available for AIX and Solaris.

  > If you are interested in obtaining a copy of SHARP APL for Linux and/or documentation for SHARP APL for Linux in PDF form please send a message to sax-linux@soliton.com.
* I contacted Soliton three times in 2007 (the copyright year on the archived website) using the stated email address, but received no response.
* Due to its age, and the complete abandonment of SHARP APL and all applications based on it, the product has no commercial value.
* It is clearly in the public's interest to have this unique piece of software available for study.

If required, I will remove this repository as quickly as reasonably possible.
